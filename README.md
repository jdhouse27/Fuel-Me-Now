With this application our goal was to create a website/app where users could create an account or log in. Once logged in the user could then fill out the request form to return avaiable or participating gas stations in the area that, if selected by the user, would then deliver the gas to the user's desired location.

Used in this application were the following: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Firebase, APIs
